## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS Styling and functions

### What I learned

I learned how to set multiple svgs as background images and how to create a reactive CSS Grid design.

I practiced creating a more accessible website by focussing on the use of semantic elements like sections. I also tried to add well defined alt text to my images and added aria-hidden="true" to the div containing the images of stars since they are purely decorative and do not add any information, and it would be uncomfortable if the screen reader read out the alt text for the star image 5 times in a row for each card.

### Continued development

I would like to keep practicing adding accessibility to my websites and creating more reactive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me see how to add more than one image to a background.
- [Different Quotation Mark Stylings](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~jamie/CS3172/examples/XHTML/entities/quotemarks.html) - This helped me to replace the given quotaion marks with the more stylized version shown in the images.
- [Aria hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-hidden) - This helped me understand the aria-hidden attribute.
